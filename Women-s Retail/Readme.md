# Project Name: Prediction of ratings based on women’s e-commerce reviews
# Problem Statement: 

    E-commerce is the activity of buying or selling of products on online services or over the Internet1. Ecommerce refers to commercial transactions conducted online. This means that whenever you buy and sell something using the Internet, you’re involved in e-commerce.

		Needless to say, e-commerce has grown by leaps and bounds since the first time e-commerce transaction was committed in 1994. BigCommerce cites that e-commerce is growing 23% year-over-year, and according to eMarkerter, global e-commerce sales are expected to top $27 trillion in 2020 — and that’s just statistics for the retail sector.

    Global retail e-commerce sales are projected to reach $27 trillion by 2020. It’s obvious that, each day e-commerce will be more and more important for the companies.

		This project aims using NLP techniques, different machine learning models and Deep Learning for predicting the rates of the products into 2 categories (good, bad).


# Data set: 
  The data set of project is from Kaggle.
  https://www.kaggle.com/nicapotato/womens-ecommerce-clothing-reviews
  
 There are 23486 rows, each representing a review for a different clothing item. 
	
	There are 10 attributes like clothing id, age, title,  review text, etc. The data set is labeled with 2 different classes. Class 1 corresponds to positively rated item. Class 0 corresponds to negatively rated item.

	The data set is looking like biased towards positive ratings but there are enough samples of negative ratings for ML models to make predictions.
  
  The CSV file uploaded to Github repository as well.
